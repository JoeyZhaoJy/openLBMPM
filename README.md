# openLBMPM
openLBMPM is an open source lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) package for multicomponent and multiphase (MCMP) flow and transport in porous media. Currently, it includes Shan-Chen method and color gradient method for MCMP system. There are two options for Shan-Chen method: (1) Original Shan-Chen method, which integrates the force term to the equilibrium velocity and cannot reach high viscosity ratio; (2) Explicit forcing model developed by M.Porter et al (2012). For color gradient model, the methods developed by Liu et.al (2014), Huang et al (2014) and Takashi et al (2018) are included. For running the codes, CUDA and numba (from Anaconda) are required
